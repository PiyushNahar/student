# student
Used Python, MySQL, HTML, and Django to create a graphical user interface for student management system. The software was created for teachers to keep track of each student's attendance and grades. Teachers would find it easy to use because it would allow them to visually compare studentsâ€™ test scores. 
all the operations are controlled by school.py
other files are just supporting files
django files are present in "names"
